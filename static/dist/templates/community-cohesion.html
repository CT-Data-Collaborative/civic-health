                <p class="lede">Social networks, whose growth is linked with decreased neighborhood crime and better individual
                    well-being, enrich communities in many ways. Strong social ties also improve specific civic interests
                    by increasing community cohesion and fueling movements for local improvement or social change.
                    Further, lower unemployment in communities with high community cohesion suggests that social
                    networks may increase economic resilience. In general, Connecticut residents’ levels of community interaction parallel national trends.</p>

                <p>Many Connecticut residents count strong ties with family and friends as a part of their everyday
                    life. But increasing interactions between acquaintances in the community — such as exchanges
                    between neighbors, participation in groups, or attendance at public meetings — could enhance
                    social cohesion in communities across the state. </p>
