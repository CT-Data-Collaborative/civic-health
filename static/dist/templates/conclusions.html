                <p class="lede">As this report has shown, there are many efforts underway to improve the civic
                    health of our state. But even with important progress, urgent challenges remain.
                <p>
                <p>There are significant gaps in the level and type of civic engagement, especially
                    between and among: those with higher income and education and those with
                    less; our younger and older residents; and people of different racial and ethnic
                    backgrounds. Only as we understand, tackle, and close these gaps can we
                    create a state that is civically, economically, and socially vibrant. </p>
                <p>Maybe you are already working on some aspect of civic health but you want to connect with others
                    across Connecticut who care about similar things. Perhaps this is the first time you have considered
                    your own role in the civic life of our state. Either way, there are many opportunities for you to be
                    part of
                    Connecticut’s rich civic life! The Civic Participation Resource Guide available online through
                    United Way’s
                    2-1-1 is a good start. You can also contact the Connecticut Civic Health Project’s Coordinator, <a
                    href="mailto:vramos@everyday-democracy.org">Valeriano Ramos</a> to learn how you can be part of the
                    work of strengthening our state’s civic health.
