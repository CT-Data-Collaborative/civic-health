                    Connecticut
                    residents engage in civic organizations and group activities, how attentive they are to community
                    problem solving and politics, and how connected they are to family, friends, and neighbors.<sup>1</sup></p>

                <p>A coalition of groups &mdash; including the Secretary of the State, Everyday Democracy, the National
                    Conference on Citizenship and DataHaven &mdash; produced <a href="{{ report2016URL }}">this latest report</a> on civic health in
                    Connecticut as a follow-up to the <a href="{{ report2011URL }}">first
                    report</a> issued in 2011.</p>
                <p>The report gives Connecticut relatively high marks compared to the national average for volunteering
                    (29.1 percent vs. 26.2 percent) and charitable giving (57.9 percent vs. 50.7 percent) in 2011, 2012
                    and 2013. Residents in Connecticut are also more likely than the rest of the country to have
                    attended a public meeting (10.5 percent vs. 8.7 percent) or worked with neighbors to fix or improve
                    something in the community (9.2 percent vs. 8.2 percent) during those years.</p>

                <p>However, there are areas that reveal a stark need for improvement and subjects that are considerable
                    cause for concern.</p>
                <p>Deep inequalities in income in Connecticut have had a negative impact on the civic engagement
                    of people living in those communities. The report notes: "The stark contrast between the wealthy
                    and the poor in our state &mdash; the so-called 'Two Connecticuts' &mdash; is as evident in
                    statistics on
                    voting behavior as it is in educational opportunity. Despite a generally higher level of
                    educational attainment in our state, people who are poor or who have lower levels of formal
                    education participate less in our government at all levels. This continues to be the primary
                    challenge for the state, one that the data and findings in this report corroborate."</p>
                <p>The findings of the report are based on an analysis of the Census Current Population Survey, as
                    well as other locally-available data sources, by the National Conference on Citizenship,
                    DataHaven, and other partners involved in this project. The National Conference on Citizenship
                    is a congressionally chartered organization dedicated to strengthening civic life in America.</p>
                <h3>Key Findings</h3>
                <p>By some indicators of civic health, Connecticut residents demonstrate significantly stronger levels
                    of engagement than the national average; they participate at higher rates of volunteering, attending
                    public meetings,
                    charitable giving, talking with and trusting neighbors, voting in local elections, and having
                    confidence in the media
                    or public schools. However, compared to other states, Connecticut performed relatively poorly in
                    other measures of
                    engagement, including registering to vote, belonging to a school or community association, joining a
                    church group or other
                    religious group, and having confidence in corporations.</p>

                <p>By many measures, high-income and college-educated adults demonstrate better civic health
                    than adults with lower income or levels of education. Participation rates based on income or
                    education
                    vary most widely on indicators of voting and volunteering.</p>

                <p>By most civic measures, participation varies between racial and ethnic groups, but White adults are
                    the most civically engaged. African Americans also demonstrate strong involvement in community
                    groups and political action. All adults connect with family and friends at equal rates.</p>
