                <p class="lede">A deeper analysis reveals notable differences in civic engagement based on demographic
                    characteristics, including age, gender, and race or ethnicity. These distinctions highlight the
                    motivations behind participation in certain activities as well as some of the barriers to vibrant
                    civic health facing certain groups. For many civic activities, differential participation rates have
                    origins more profound than individual choice and may be emblematic of systemic inequities.<sup>1</sup></p>
                <p>The <a href="http://ncoc.net/index.php?download=114kcfl587">2011 Connecticut Civic Health Index
                    Report</a> noted patterns of engagement based on
                    economic factors, which 2015 data continue to reflect. Civic engagement correlates strongly
                    with education and income. Generally, it is highest among college-educated adults or residents
                    of top-earning households, with the exception of some indicators of social interaction. </p>

                <p>Civic participation increases with age, according to measures in this Index. Generally, young
                    adults demonstrate the lowest rates of engagement, which peak among older adults, including
                    the Baby Boomer Generation or the Silent Generation. Civic data reflect the relative political
                    disengagement of Connecticut youth.</p>

                <p>In most spheres of civic health, women are slightly more engaged than men. But for certain
                    activities, exceptional gender-based distinctions arise. For example, in 2013 women were much more
                    likely to volunteer than men (31.1% and 24.2%
                    respectively), or to be involved in school, neighborhood, or community groups and with religious
                    institutions. Yet a significantly larger share of men than women participated in sports or recreation
                    groups and service or civic associations. Notwithstanding these findings, participation of women in
                    Connecticut’s state boards and commissions continues to lag behind that of their male
                    counterparts. </p>

                <p>Statewide, engagement in civic activities varies between racial and ethnic groups. In general,
                    White followed by African American/Black residents have the highest levels of involvement, while
                    Asian American and Latino adults demonstrate lower participation. However, many distinctions
                    in civic habits based on race or ethnicity may be related to larger socioeconomic and structural
                    inequities </p>

                <p>In addition to the aforementioned characteristics, the propensity of racial and ethnic minorities to
                    be young and to switch residences may cause their participation rates in these civic activities to
                    generally be lower than Whites’ </p>
