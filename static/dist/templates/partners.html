                    <p>William Caspar Graustein Memorial Fund has as its new mission achieving equity in education by
                        working with those affected and inspiring all to end racism and poverty. In recognition of the depth
                        and persistence of racial and economic
                        inequality and its impact on children and families, the Fund has laid out a new strategic plan to
                        guide the work of removing barriers to
                        educational opportunity. This new mission emphasizes the importance of one of our state’s strongest
                        assets – the families and neighborhoods
                        that have direct experience in raising children and dealing with the barriers of racism and poverty.
                        The Fund believes that within all of
                        us, and especially those most affected by racism and poverty, there are the strengths,
                        determination, creativity, and wisdom we need to
                        succeed.</p>

                    <h3><a href="www.fundforgreaterhartford.org/">THE FUND FOR GREATER HARTFORD</a></h3>
                    <p>The Fund for Greater Hartford, formerly known as The Hartford Courant Foundation, was started in
                        1950, with its incorporation as a public foundation. In the early years, the Foundation’s annual
                        grants were funded by contributions
                        from The Hartford Courant, one of the states’ leading newspapers. The Fund entered a new era in
                        1979, when the 215-year-old Hartford
                        Courant was purchased by Times Mirror Corporation of Los Angeles. The Hartford Courant Foundation’s
                        trustees understood the importance of
                        the Foundation to the community, so as part of the purchase agreement the Foundation was
                        restructured to become a private, independent
                        foundation. The assets of The Fund, which consisted of stock in the Hartford Courant, were converted
                        into a significant endowment which
                        now funds the grants distributed each year. In 2014 alone, The Fund for Greater Hartford committed
                        more than $600,000 to the Greater
                        Hartford community with a focus on its four priority areas: Arts, Community Development, Education
                        and Health and Social Services. </p>
