                <p class="lede">A healthy democracy is based on a strong relationship between elected officials and their constituents.
                    Participation in the democratic process is one of the most direct forms of civic engagement, allowing
                    residents to impact their community through opinion and action, and many consider it to be a civic duty.
                    Political participation is often measured through registration and voting, but informal action — through
                    non-electoral civic activities — is also indicative of an individual’s or a community’s commitment to
                    improving local and national affairs.<sup>1</sup></p>
                <p>In 2012, the year of the last presidential election, Connecticut had a relatively low voter registration
                    rate (70.5% of eligible adults, ranked 34th) and an average voter turnout (62.7% of adults registered
                    to vote, ranked 26th). </p>

                <p>Expressing an opinion is a popular form of political engagement, with more than a quarter of
                    Connecticut residents talking with family members and friends about politics and nearly one in ten
                    using the Internet to share an opinion on a public issue.</p>
